      A mobile phone, cell phone, cellphone, or hand phone, sometimes shortened to simply mobile, cell or just phone, is
      a portable telephone that can make and receive calls over a radio frequency link while the user is moving within a
      telephone service area. The radio frequency link establishes a connection to the switching systems of a mobile
      phone operator, which provides access to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Modern mobile telephone
      services use a cellular network architecture, and, therefore, mobile telephones are called cellular telephones or
      cell phones, in North America. In addition to telephony, 2000s-era mobile phones support a variety of other
      services, such as text messaging, MMS, email, Internet access, short-range wireless communications (infrared,
      Bluetooth), business applications, video games, and digital photography. Mobile phones offering only those
      capabilities are known as feature phones; mobile phones which offer greatly advanced computing capabilities are
      referred to as smartphones.

      A camera is an optical instrument to capture still images or to record moving images, which are stored in a
      physical medium such as in a digital system or on photographic film. A camera consists of a lens which focuses
      light from the scene, and a camera body which holds the image capture mechanism.
      The still image camera is the main instrument in the art of photography and captured images may be reproduced
      later as a part of the process of photography, digital imaging, photographic printing. The similar artistic fields
      in the moving image camera domain are film, videography, and cinematography.
