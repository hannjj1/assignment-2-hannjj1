    <h2>Cameras</h2>
    <p>
      A camera is an optical instrument to capture still images or to record moving images, which are stored in a
      physical medium such as in a digital system or on photographic film. A camera consists of a lens which focuses
      light from the scene, and a camera body which holds the image capture mechanism.
      The still image camera is the main instrument in the art of photography and captured images may be reproduced
      later as a part of the process of photography, digital imaging, photographic printing. The similar artistic fields
      in the moving image camera domain are film, videography, and cinematography.
